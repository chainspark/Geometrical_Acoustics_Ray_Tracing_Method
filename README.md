# Geometrical_Acoustics_Ray_Tracing_Method

The sound pressure level inside a cuboidal room with only one reflecting layer (bottom layer) due to source placed at center of room is visualized below.
The Ray-tracing method is used with complex pressure variable to calculate sound pressure level.
The interference effect due to path length differences and their relation with source frequency from the reflecting plane are observed clearly.
